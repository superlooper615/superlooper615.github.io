        <h2 class="question-title">A company is migrating its database servers from Amazon EC2 instances that run Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server DB instances. The company's analytics team must export large data elements every day until the migration is complete. The data elements are the result of SQL joins across multiple tables. The data must be in Apache Parquet format. The analytics team must store the data in Amazon S3.Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST operationally efficient way?A.Create a view in the EC2 instance-based SQL Server databases that contains the required data elements. Create an AWS Glue job that selects the data directly from the view and transfers the data in Parquet format to an S3 bucket. Schedule the AWS Glue job to run every day.B.Schedule SQL Server Agent to run a daily SQL query that selects the desired data elements from the EC2 instance-based SQL Server databases. Configure the query to direct the output .csv objects to an S3 bucket. Create an S3 event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to transform the output format from .csv to Parquet.C.Use a SQL query to create a view in the EC2 instance-based SQL Server databases that contains the required data elements. Create and run an AWS Glue crawler to read the view. Create an AWS Glue job that retrieves the data and transfers the data in Parquet format to an S3 bucket. Schedule the AWS Glue job to run every day.D.Create an AWS Lambda function that queries the EC2 instance-based databases by using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

        <h2 class="question-title">A company is building an inventory management system and an inventory reordering system to automatically reorder products. Both systems use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. The inventory management system uses the Amazon Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) to publish data to a stream. The inventory reordering system uses the Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to consume data from the stream. The company configures the stream to scale up and down as needed.Before the company deploys the systems to production, the company discovers that the inventory reordering system received duplicated data.Which factors could have caused the reordering system to receive duplicated data?
