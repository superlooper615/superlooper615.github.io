        <ol class="answer-options">
            <li class='highlight'>A.Change the Firehose output format to Apache Parquet. Provide a custom S3 object YYYYMMDD prefix expression and specify a large buffer size.

            <li>A.Use an Amazon EventBridge rule to run an AWS Glue job every 15 minutes. Configure the AWS Glue job to process and load the data into the Amazon Redshift tables.</li>
            <li class='highlight'>B.Use an Amazon EventBridge rule to invoke an AWS Glue workflow job every 15 minutes. Configure the AWS Glue workflow to have an on-demand trigger that runs an AWS Glue crawler and then runs an AWS Glue job when the crawler finishes running successfully. Configure the AWS Glue job to process and load the data into the Amazon Redshift tables.</li>
            <li>C.Configure an AWS Lambda function to invoke an AWS Glue crawler when a file is loaded into the S3 bucket. Configure an AWS Glue job to process and load the data into the Amazon Redshift tables. Create a second Lambda function to run the AWS Glue job. Create an Amazon EventBridge rule to invoke the second Lambda function when the AWS Glue crawler finishes running successfully.</li>
            <li class='highlight'>D.Configure an AWS Lambda function to invoke an AWS Glue workflow when a file is loaded into the S3 bucket. Configure the AWS Glue workflow to have an on-demand trigger that runs an AWS Glue crawler and then runs an AWS Glue job when the crawler finishes running successfully. Configure the AWS Glue job to process and load the data into the Amazon Redshift tables.</li>
            <li>E.Configure an AWS Lambda function to invoke an AWS Glue job when a file is loaded into the S3 bucket. Configure the AWS Glue job to read the files from the S3 bucket into an Apache Spark DataFrame. Configure the AWS Glue job to also put smaller partitions of the DataFrame into an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. Configure the delivery stream to load data into the Amazon Redshift tables.</li>
